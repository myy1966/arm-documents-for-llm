A transaction operates between a Requester component and one or more Subordinate components, and can pass through one or more intermediate components. At any intermediate component, for a given transaction, upstream means between that component and the originating Requester component, and includes the originating Requester component.

Downstream and upstream are defined relative to the transaction as a whole, not relative to individual data flows within the transaction.

See also Downstream, Requester component, Peer to Peer, Subordinate component.

**Write-Back cache**

A cache in which when a cache hit occurs on a store access, the data is only written to the cache. Data in the cache can therefore be more up-to-date than data in main memory. Any such data is written back to main memory when the cache line is cleaned or re-allocated. Another common term for a Write-Back cache is a CopyBack cache.
