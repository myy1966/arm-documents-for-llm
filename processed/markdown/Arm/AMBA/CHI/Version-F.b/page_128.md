In a combined Ordered Write Observation (OWO) Write request, if the write is canceled and the Requester sends a WriteDataCancel, the required cache maintenance on the write data is not carried out. The Requester must resend both the Write request and the CMO:

- If a Write with PCMO had its write canceled:

    - The Persist response for the combined request does not indicate that the write data is made persistent.
    - The Requester must resend the PCMO either combined with the resent Write request or after the resent Write request succeeds.

- If a Write with CMO had its write canceled:

    - The Requester must resend the CMO, either combined with the re-sent Write request or after the resent Write request succeeds.
