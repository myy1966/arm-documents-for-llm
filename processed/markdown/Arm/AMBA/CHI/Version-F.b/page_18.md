# Using this specification

The information in this specification is organized into parts, as described in this section:

**Chapter B1 Introduction**

Read this for an introduction to the CHI architecture and the terminology in this specification.

**Chapter B2 Transactions**

Read this for an overview of the communication channels between nodes, the associated packet fields, transaction structures, transaction ID flows, and the supported transaction ordering.

**Chapter B3 Network Layer**

Read this for a description of the Network layer that is responsible for determining the node ID of a destination node.

**Chapter B4 Coherence Protocol**

Read this for an introduction to the coherence protocol.

**Chapter B5 Interconnect Protocol Flows**

Read this for examples of protocol flows for different transaction types.

**Chapter B6 Exclusive accesses**

Read this for a description of the mechanisms that the architecture includes to support Exclusive accesses.

**Chapter B7 Cache Stashing**

Read this for a description of the cache stashing mechanism whereby data can be installed in a cache.

**Chapter B8 DVM Operations**

Read this for a description of DVM operations that the protocol uses to manage virtual memory.

**Chapter B9 Error Handling**

Read this for a description of the error response requirements.

**Chapter B10 Realm Management Extension**

Read this for a description of the Realm Management Extension (RME).

**Chapter B11 System Control, Debug, Trace, and Monitoring**

Read this for a description of the mechanisms that provide additional support for the control, debugging, tracing, and performance measurement of systems.

**Chapter B12 Memory Tagging**

Read this for a description of the Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) that provides a mechanism to check the correct usage of data held in memory.

**Chapter B13 Link Layer**

Read this for a description of the Link layer that provides a mechanism for packet based communication between protocol nodes and the interconnect.

**Chapter B14 Link Handshake**

Read this for a description of the Link layer handshake requirements.
