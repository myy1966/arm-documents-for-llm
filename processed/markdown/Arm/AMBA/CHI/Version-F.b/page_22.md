## Signals

The signal conventions are:

**Signal level** The level of an asserted signal depends on whether the signal is active-HIGH or active-LOW. Asserted means:

- HIGH for active-HIGH signals.
- LOW for active-LOW signals.

**Lowercase n** At the start or end of a signal name denotes an active-LOW signal.

## Numbers

Numbers are normally written in decimal. Binary numbers are preceded by 0b, and hexadecimal numbers by 0x. Both are written in a monospace font.
