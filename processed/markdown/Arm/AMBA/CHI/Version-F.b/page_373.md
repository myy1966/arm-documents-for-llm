## B10.1 Introduction

RME is one component of the Arm Confidential Computer Architecture (CCA). Together with the other components of the Arm CCA, RME enables support for dynamic, attestable, and trusted execution environments, also called Realms, to be run on an Arm PE.

RME provides hardware-based isolation that allows execution contexts to run in different Security states and share resources in the system.
