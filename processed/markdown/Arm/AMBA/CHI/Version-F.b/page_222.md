An HN-F is permitted, but not expected, to be the target Home Node for the WriteNoSnpDef request. An HN-F, that receives an unexpected WriteNoSnpDef request, must not forward the WriteNoSnpDef request to an SN-F. The HN-F must return a response of OK/Unsupported.

If a Home Node detects that a Deferrable write is targeting a Subordinate that does not support Deferrable writes, the transaction must not be propagated. The Home is expected to send an OK/Unsupported response. The Home is permitted to send NDERR response instead of the OK/Unsupported response.

#### B4.5.1.4 Miscellaneous transaction completion

A Comp response, with the Resp field set to 0, is always used for DVM transaction completion.

### B4.5.2 WriteData response

The WriteData response is part of Write request and DVMOp transactions. The Requester sends WriteData to the Completer after receiving a guarantee that a buffer is available to accept the data. Buffer availability is signaled through a DBIDResp or DBIDRespOrd response sent from the Completer.

The WriteData response is sent on the WDAT channel and uses the following opcodes.
