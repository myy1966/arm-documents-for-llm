If Home issues a Comp instead of CompDBIDResp, a following CompAck response must be observed from the Requester to complete the CopyBack Write transaction. See B4.5.4 Miscellaneous response for details on how Home can interpret the possible CompAck responses.

#### B2.7.8.2 CAH usage at Request Node

The Requester or Snoopee handles the CAH attribute in the following way:

- If the CAH attribute has a value of 1 in a CompData or DataSepResp response, a Requester is permitted, but not required, to cache a value of 1 for CAH.
- If the CAH attribute has a value of 0 in a CompData or DataSepResp response, a Requester must not cache a value of 1 for CAH.
- A Requester is not required to cache an incoming CAH value. If the CAH value is not cached, the value must be assumed to be 0.
- When the line or MTE tags are updated, a cache must clear the CAH attribute to 0.

    - The CAH attribute can be cleared to 0 in a cache at any point.
