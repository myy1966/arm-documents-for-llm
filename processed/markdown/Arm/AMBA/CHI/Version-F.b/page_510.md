| Y        | Applicable. Field value is used. See specification for permitted values and usage.                                                                                                                            |

| 8B       | Size field must be set to 8-byte encoding.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 64B      | Size field must be set to 64-byte encoding.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| M        | Field position reused for DVM operations. See (DVM Operations)                                                                                                                                                |
| -        | Assigned to another protocol message field that shares the same set of bits in this packet field. If the other field is not present, then it is considered inapplicable and the field value must be set to 0. |
