## C2.1 Request communicating nodes

Table C2.1 shows the Request communicating nodes. In Table C2.1, unless explicitly stated otherwise, a reference to a Write transaction includes both the individual Write transaction and the corresponding Combined Write transaction.

For some Requests, both an expected target and a permitted target are given. The use of the permitted target can occur in the case of a software based error. The permitted target must complete the transaction in a protocol compliant manner, this might require the use of an error response.
