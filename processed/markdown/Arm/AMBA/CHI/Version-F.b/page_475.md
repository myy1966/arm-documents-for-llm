| STOP               | The Transmitter has no credits and must not send any flits. </br> The Transmitter is guaranteed not to receive any credits. </br> The Transmitter must assert **LINKACTIVEREQ** to move to the ACTIVATE state if flits must be sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The Receiver is guaranteed not to receive any flits. </br> The Receiver must not send any credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ACTIVATE (ACT)     | The Transmitter must not send any flits. </br> The Transmitter must be prepared to receive credits in this state. However, the Transmitter must not use them until in the RUN state. </br> The Transmitter remains in the ACTIVATE state while waiting for the Receiver to acknowledge the move to the RUN state. </br> **Note** </br> The Transmitter only receives credits in the ACTIVATE state when there is a race between the Receiver sending credits and asserting **LINKACTIVEACK** to move to the RUN state. | The Receiver is guaranteed not to receive any flits. </br> The Receiver must not send any credits. </br> The ACTIVATE state is a transient state and the Receiver controls the move to the RUN state by asserting **LINKACTIVEACK**. </br> The Receiver must assert **LINKACTIVEACK** and move to the RUN state before sending credits. It is permitted, but not required, to assert **LINKACTIVEACK** and send a credit in the same cycle. </br> **Note** </br> A Receiver can appear to have sent credits in the ACTIVATE state if there is a race between the Receiver sending credits and asserting **LINKACTIVEACK** to move to the RUN state. |
| RUN                | The Transmitter can receive credits. </br> The Transmitter can send flits when credits are available. </br> The Transmitter deasserts **LINKACTIVEREQ** to exit from this state if low power state is desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The Receiver can receive flits corresponding to the credits previously sent. </br> The Receiver sends credits when resources are available to accept further flits. </br> The Receiver must remain in the RUN state until observing the deassertion of **LINKACTIVEREQ**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| DEACTIVATE (DEACT) | The Transmitter must return credits using Protocol flits or L-Credit return flits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | During this state, the Receiver stops sending credits and collects all returned credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
